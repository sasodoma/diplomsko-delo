	abstract = {The electric railway system is the highest class of energy efficient transportation means. This is due to two important points: (i) low running resistance (including low energy losses) and (ii) energy regeneration in braking. Regenerative braking of railway electric vehicles is effective when the other powering ones, in other words electrical load, exist near the regenerating train on the same electrified line. So, early in the morning and at midnight, or in the low-density district lines, regeneration cancellation phenomenon often occurs and the regenerative brake force cannot be operated in accordance with the recommended value. Newly appeared high-performance energy storage devices press the issues of energy storage and reuse technologies on ground and on vehicles. Hybrid energy source is one effective solution. In this paper, as an example, we show our trolley and on-board battery hybrid controlled tramcar, developed to reduce regeneration cancellation. With the trolley line collective power as well as charge and discharge power of the on-board lithium ion rechargeable battery, the hybrid energy providing and regenerating technology is achieved. The running test results show a maximum regenerative ratio of 44\%, which is top class value in an electric railway system. Copyright © 2007 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a robust, intelligent constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) charger for fast charging an aging Lithium-ion battery. Increasing the charging current in the CC regime cannot guarantee the short charging time, so an optimal charging current exists in the CC-CV method. The optimal charging current changes with battery degradation, so this paper figures out a way to find the optimal charging current by applying direct current internal resistance (DCIR) tests before the CC-CV charging method. The experiment results show that the proposed charger can adjust the optimal current based on battery state-of-health (SOH). The charging time has a 6.5\% improvement when it is compared to a standard CC-CV fast charger.},

	abstract = {This chapter provides the time domain description of ideal inductors and capacitors and reviews the ideal versions of each type of switching supply. An ideal buck converter regulator is made of an ideal voltage source, an ideal voltage controlled switch, an ideal diode, an ideal inductor, an ideal capacitor, and a load resistor. It is called a buck converter because the voltage across the inductor “bucks” or opposes the supply voltage. The output voltage of a buck converter is always less than the input voltage. The diode acts as a voltage-controlled switch. It provides a path for the inductor current once the switch is opened. No current flows through the diode while the inductor is charging because it is reverse biased. When the control switch opens, the inductor current flows through the diode. It is possible for the buck converter to work in discontinuous mode, which means that the inductor current goes to zero during part of the switching period.},

Reliability of power supply from renewable and conventional sources can improve by using battery as energy storage medium. Battery can be charge by using solar energy for use of renewable energy or by power supply for use of conventional energy supply. Different battery shows different voltage and current characteristics when charged by using power supply.

The transformerless topology uses a small capacitor to transfer energy to the high-side switch from a single power supply referred to the negative rail. Unlike conventional bootstrap power supplies, no switching of the main phase-leg switches is required to provide power continuously to the high-side gate drive, even if the high-side switch is permanently on. Additional advantages include low parts-count and simple control requirements. A piecewise linear model of the self-boost charge pump is derived and the circuit's operating characteristics are analyzed. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the desired operation of the new charge pump circuit. Guidelines are provided to assist with circuit component selection in new applications.},
